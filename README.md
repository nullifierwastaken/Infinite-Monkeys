# Infinite Monkeys
The Infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey randomly hitting individual keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type the entire works of William Shakespeare eventually. This program simulates the Infinite monkey theorem.  
(Note: this is a joke repo)  
I got the works of Shakespeare from this git repo: https://github.com/GITenberg/The-Complete-Works-of-William-Shakespeare_100/tree/master
